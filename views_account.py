        Simply logging in the user may become a security issue. If you
        do not take proper care (e.g. don't purge used email
        confirmations), a malicious person that got hold of the link
        will be able to login over and over again and the user is
        unable to do anything about it. Even restoring their own mailbox
        security will not help, as the links will still work. For
        password reset this is different, this mechanism works only as
        long as the attacker has access to the mailbox. If they no
        longer has access they cannot issue a password request and
        intercept it. Furthermore, all places where the links are
        listed (log files, but even Google Analytics) all of a sudden
        need to be secured. Purging the email confirmation once
        confirmed changes the behavior -- users will not be able to
        repeatedly confirm (in case they forgot that they already
        clicked the mail).

        All in all, opted for storing the user that is in the process
        of signing up in the session to avoid all of the above.  This
        may not 100% work in case the user closes the browser (and the
        session gets lost), but at least we're secure.
